Interest of content
    The content of the website was interesting and provided a good basic overview of a few fields within computer science. Each page is a good entry point into learnging about these areas, however, it would benefit the website to include more links to external websites which go into further depth of each topic. 

Consistency and quality of visual presentation
    The website has a consistent and aesthetically pleasing theme. The primary colours chosen compliment each other well and are carried through to each page.

Quality of written presentation
    The written presentation is strong with a large title on the home page and clear headers on each other page. More formatting and variety to style could be added to the content on each page so that different sections stand out from each other.

Validity of HTML
    The HTML is all valid and is presented very cleanly making it easy to read.

Evidence of collaboration including
    The author info was not written by the author of each page. The footers were added by other contributors.
    Furthermore, it seems as if each member created their own page of content, meaning that there was balanced contributions from members.
